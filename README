	
	jQuery plugin for showing Team City build status.
	
	Usage: 	
		<script src="jquery.js" />
		<script language="javascript">
			$(".tc-status").TCBuild({url: 'http://teamcityserver/guestAuth/api/rest', interval: 10000 });
		</script>
		<div class="tc-status" dagta-buildtype="bt2" />
		
	This will pull the build status from TeamCity every <interval>, and fill the <div> with these elments:
		<img name="statusimage"...>
		<div name="buildtypename" ...>
		<div name="buildstatus" ...>
		
	The ASP.NET project set up using ManagedFusion.Rewriter to act as a reverse proxy in case this isn't hosted on your TeamCity server, because that would't work because of the Same-Origin policy.
